A tricky platformer Game

By Epixyl (Jason Wu)

You are an adventurer who has gone out of his way to recover a magical banana that will grant eternal happiness.
However, little do you know that the banana's powers have shifted reality around it's location, causing blocks to be
where they are not supposed to be, spikes to fly around, as well as bullets running rampant around the region.

Can you survive to collect the magical banana?

================

Controls:
Arrow keys:   Move
Up:           Jump

There are several checkpoints scattered throughout in case you die!

Good Luck!
